Enjoy your csv transformation

Requirements:
  - Node v14.15 or higher 
  - yarn 2 

Usage:  
1) Install dependencies
```
yarn 
```
2) General cli usage
```
node index.js <MODE> <INPUT_FILE_PATH> <OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>
```
3) Run demo usecase:
```
node index.js demo demo.csv output/demo.csv
```
Checkout `demo.csv`. In the demo usecase we want to rename the column `description` to `name` and trim all the values. Further we add `0.10` to every value in the price column. Checkout the result in `output/demo.csv`. If everything is fine your setup is correct and you are good to go!

4) Create your own mode for your usecase:  
 - Add a new mode in the `src/modes/` directory. After having a look on the demo implementation this should be self explanatory.
 - Import the new mode in `index.js` and add it to the switch statement.

5) Running tests
```
yarn test
```
6) Please ensure git hooks are running before commit to ensure code style, formatting and tests!
